## Code reviews and submission ##

Coming soon, instructions on the code review process similiar to that of the [Rietveld project](http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/Contributing), using [Rietveld](http://codereview.appspot.com/) itself.

## Style ##

The code will conform as closely as possible to the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html). Editor macros to help with this are available in the [google-styleguide source tree](http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/source/browse/trunk).
